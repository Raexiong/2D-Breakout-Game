<!-- My Game Logic:
    The Score keeps on adding until you lose a life, then the score will be reset to 0;
    High Score is the maximum bricks you hit within one life;
    If you hit 15 bricks within one life, level will add by 1; and speed will increase to 1.2 multiples, paddle width will decrease by 5;
    But if you start a new life, ball speed, paddle with will be reset to initial value.
    If your level increase, there will be alert.
